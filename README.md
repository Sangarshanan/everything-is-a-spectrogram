# Everything is a Spectrogram

An experimental performance tool that converts images captured from your webcam into sound by interpreting them as frequency spectrograms.

![alt text](https://github.com/Sangarshanan/everything-is-a-spectrogram/blob/main/static/spec.png "Spec")

One can either click on the button to take an image or checking continuous will click images continuously to be turned into sound, There are also Parameters that can be tuned to change the duration and timbre of the sound.

- Min/ Max Freq: Frequency range mapped to the image height.
- Waveform: Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth.
- Musical Quantization: Snaps frequencies to the nearest musical note.
- Contrast: Enhances image features for clearer sound.
- Stereo Envelope: Adds stereo width and amplitude shaping.

This is not new, there is a long history of musicians hiding visuals inside their tracks, One of the most prominent examples of this is in Aphex Twin’s track `∆Mᵢ⁻¹=−α ∑ Dᵢ[η][ ∑ Fjᵢ[η−1]+Fextᵢ [η⁻¹]]` often referred to as "Formula" from the B-side of "Windowlicker". Using the program "Metasynth", Aphex was able to embed an image at the end of the track.

The electronic music scene hasn’t been the only one to incorporate this trend, however. Nine Inch Nails used an image in the spectrogram of "My Violent Heart". Unsurprisingly, there is once again a hint of the image in the album cover art.

> This project is an attempt to turn this idea into an experimental performance tool or installation where sound is generated continuously by converting the image captured every X seconds into the spectrogram.

Feel free to raise an issue if you have any thoughts or ideas :)
