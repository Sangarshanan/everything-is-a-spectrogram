One can either click on the button to take an image or checking continuous will click images continuously to be turned into sound, There are also Parameters that can be tuned to change the duration and timbre of the sound.

- Min/ Max Freq: Frequency range mapped to the image height.
- Waveform: Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth.
- Musical Quantization: Snaps frequencies to the nearest musical note.
- Contrast: Enhances image features for clearer sound.
- Stereo Envelope: Adds stereo width and amplitude shaping.
